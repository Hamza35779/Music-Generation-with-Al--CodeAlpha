# Music-Generation-with-Al--CodeAlpha
Collect MIDI music data to train your Al model (classical, jazz etc.). Preprocess the data into note sequences suitable for training. Build a deep learning model using RNNs (like LSTM) or GANs to learn music patterns. Train the model on the dataset to generate new music sequences. Convert generated sequences to MIDI and play or save them as audio.
